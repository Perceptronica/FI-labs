What these words mean is difficult to determine, but clearly they are insulting, and clearly Shakespeare is the object of the sarcasms. 
When the book in which they appear (Greenes, groats-worth of witte, bought with a million of Repentance, 1592) was published after Greeneâ€™s death, a mutual acquaintance wrote a preface offering an apology to Shakespeare and testifying to his worth. 
This preface also indicates that Shakespeare was by then making important friends. 
For, although the puritanical city of London was generally hostile to the theatre, many of the nobility were good patrons of the drama and friends of the actors. 
Shakespeare seems to have attracted the attention of the young Henry Wriothesley, the 3rd earl of Southampton, and to this nobleman were dedicated his first published poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece.
